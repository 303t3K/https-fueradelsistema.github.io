Biography
DJ FRANCES , also known as 303T3K, is an Argentine DJ and live artist recognized as one of the first pioneers of acid techno and free tekno culture in Argentina, With over 27 years of experience, he played a key role in introducing and developing the underground free party movement in South America starting in the mid-90s. At a time when the Argentine electronic scene was dominated by commercial minimal and progressive sounds imposed by the mainstream, DJ Francés brought a raw and uncompromising approach, inspired by European teknivals, free parties, iligal under parties and sound system culture, with whom he shared experience as a DJ during the years he lived in London and Barcelona (1996/1999)
His sets then mixed acid techno, hardtek, and tribe, emphasizing high energy, hypnotic structures, and the distinctive resonance of the Roland TB-303 sound.

The Free Parties and OUT OF SYSTEM

As a core member of Out Of System, DJ Francés helped organize and perform at some of the first authentic free tekno events in Argentina. These events were rooted in DIY ethics, autonomy, and community-driven values, establishing a new underground network outside of commercial club structures.

Out Of System became one of the earliest platforms connecting South America with the European free tekno circuit, contributing to the development of a local scene inspired by teknival culture.
